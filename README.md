# Epiméros

## Name [fix section later]
Epiméros comes from Epimerase -> Epimer -> Epi & mer -> Epi & méros
Epimerase is an enzyme that "catalyzes the stereochemical inversion of the configuration" (Rotation seemed significant as well). This should be researched more, but I am going to assume this means it changes a molecule in a small way that would be equivalent enough to how an assembler takes basic assembly and converts it to machine code.
